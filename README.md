## Meme generator

This is one of the challeges from Scrimba, part of [React Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) with Bob Ziroll.

In this fun project, a user has the ability to enter the text that shows up on top and the text that shows up on bottom, and also to click a button to randomly chose a new meme image. On the first load of the website, it will reach out to API to get 100 of the most popular memes at the time.

The main puprose of this project was to learn and practice:

- using props to create reusable components
- working with API
- working with figma design files
- events listeners
- State
- conditional rendering
- forms
- Side Effect
